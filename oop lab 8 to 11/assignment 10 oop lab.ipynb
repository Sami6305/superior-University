    "Task 1; Program to manage employee personal details:\n",
    "1. Define a parent class called Employee with private attributes name, age, and\n",
    "salary. Implement getter and setter methods for each attribute to ensure controlled\n",
    "access to the data.\n",
    "2. Create a child class Manager inheriting from Employee. The Manager class\n",
    "should have an additional private attribute called department. Implement getter and\n",
    "setter methods for the department attribute.\n",
    "3. Create another child class Worker inheriting from Employee. The Worker class\n",
    "should have an additional private attribute called hours_worked. Implement getter\n",
    "and setter methods for the hours_worked attribute.\n",
    "4. Implement file handling to store and retrieve information about employees. Use a\n",
    "CSV file format to store the information in a structured manner, where each row\n",
    "represents an employee and each column represents an attribute (name, age, salary,\n",
    "department, hours_worked).\n",
    "5. Develop functions to add new employees, display information of all employees,\n",
    "update employee information, and delete employees from the records. Ensure that\n",
    "these functions interact with the Employee class and its subclasses using\n",
    "appropriate encapsulation techniques.\n",
    "6. Provide a user interface to interact with the program, allowing users to perform\n",
    "operations like adding, displaying, updating, and deleting employee information\n",
    "through a menu-driven interface."
